rat

Hello darkness, my old friend...

I've come to talk with you again...

Because a vision softly cre-eeping,

Left its seeds while I was sle-eeping,

And the rat, that was planted, in my brain

Still remains...

Within the sound, of silence

STOP POSTING ABOUT GREGTECH, I'M TIRED OF SEEING IT! My friends on reddit send me memes, on discord it's fucking memes - I was in a subreddit, right? and ALLLLLLLLL of the POSTS are just GregTech stuff. I- I showed my Champion underwear to my girlfriend, and the logo I flipped it and I said, "Hey babe: When the underwear greg ðŸ˜‚ ðŸ˜‚ ðŸ˜‚"
