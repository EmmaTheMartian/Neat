# Neat

This is a Discord bot, made to add the "Neat is a mod by Vaskii" and other joke replies from the r/feedthememes subreddit to Discord.

Any time you have "neat" in a message, it replies.

Same goes for "greg" and "rat"

Oh and there's also a `/mod` command to get a mod. Arguments are provided as auto-complete.

## Invite

Just click the link, invite the bot. Dead-Simple.
